# My Bevy Test

This is me messing with the bevy engine (https://bevyengine.org/) which is pretty
awesome!
This example lets you move the camera with the arrow keys.  It will look down 
by 45 degrees to the ground.  But there is more:  a cube!  You can press space 
and the game will spawn another cube on the center of the screen.   If 
you click on the cube, you can move it with ASDW-keys.
